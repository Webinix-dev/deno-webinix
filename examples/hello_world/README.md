# Webinix Examples - Deno

This is an example of how to use the Webinix dynamic library in Deno to create an
HTML5 based user interface.

Tested using Deno v1.34 and v1.35.

### Deno Hello World

This example shows how to use the Webinix in Deno.

1. Download and [Install Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases) (_Or
   just copy deno binary file into this folder_)
2. Run `deno run --allow-all --unstable hello_world.ts`

If any issue with during library loading a local version (Webinix pre-built
library at [webinix.me](https://webinix.me/)) can be used.
